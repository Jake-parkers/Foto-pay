# Foto-pay
A simple payment concept integrating Flutterwave's Rave api

Getting Started

A simple library to interact directly with Rave api was created and is contained in libraries/ravepay.js

Testing

All tests are contained in the test/ folder. 

The third test has been commented out and should be run only after the first two tests have been run

To run tests, do:

npm test

once this test is passed, comment out the first two tests and uncomment the last test and follow the instructions in the comment then run:

â€˜npm testâ€™ again
